#when trying transdecoder long orfs with following usage:

~/Transdecoder-Transdecoder-v5.5.0 TransDecoder.LongOrfs -t /lustre/scratch/sabaty/melanerpes-project/assemblies/full-trinity-flag/Trinity.fasta


#received error: "Can't locate URI/Escape.pm in @INC"
#need to install URI Escape so to do this you can do:

perl -MCPAN -e shell 


#and then follow the installation steps and once that finishes, do

install URI::Escape


#after that is finished, I had to make sure compute_base_probs.pl under TransDecoder-TransDecoder-v/util was executable.

chmod +x compute_base_probs.pl
